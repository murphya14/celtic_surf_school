          <p class="text-dark font_custom"> <br> 
Hi,  <br>
 <br>
 

Iâ€™m Kealan, owner of Celtic Surf School. <br>   <br>

 

The Atlantic Ocean is where I spend majority of my time and where I feel most comfortable so I chose to work in there too! My aim for Celtic Surf School, is to share my workplace and ignite this same passion in others. 

 

My training began at age 14 when I began water safety and swimming training. I then worked as a lifeguard and ultimately, became a surf instructor for which I have been for many years throughout the coast of Clare.
 <br> <br>
 

I have travelled around Ireland, from Kerry to Donegal, surfing many different waves in order to develop my skills and become a more well-rounded surfer. With the help of my peers, I have overcome more than I ever thought I would in terms of surfing, and am constantly excelling at it while still constantly learning. 



This is the kind of community we have in Celtic Surf School (no matter the level); teamwork makes the dream work.  

  <br> <br>

I have been lucky enough to have spent time surfing in Europe. However, I still feel that Ireland is the best spot. The emerald isle is a hidden gem (as long as you can keep warm.) The scenic surf locations in Ireland are beyond description and inspire adventure, it is a gift that keeps on giving. 

 

At Celtic Surf School, my team and I want you to have some fun (catching a wave is a bonus.) 

I enjoy sharing my passion for surfing and teaching it to people of all ages, on many different levels. It is great to help someone ride a wave for the first time and see the smiles on people's faces, it is a great accomplishment to me.  

 

I will give you the time and experience I have learned over the years to help you become more comfortable in the ocean so you too can ride the waves and enjoy the fruits of the North Atlantic Sea.  

  <br> <br>

We hope here, at Celtic Surf School, that you will have a great experience in the ocean and learn how to catch some waves with us and our team  
 <br>
  <br>

Thanks for reading 
 <br>
  <br>
