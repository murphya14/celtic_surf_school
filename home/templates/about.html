          <p class="text-dark font_custom"> <br> 
Hi,  <br>
 <br>
 

Iâ€™m Kealan, owner of Celtic Surf School. <br>   <br>

 

The Atlantic Ocean is where I spend majority of my time and where I feel most comfortable so I chose to work in there too! My aim for Celtic Surf School, is to share my workplace and ignite this same passion in others. 

 
 <br> <br>
I began water safety and swimming training at 14 and continued on to become a lifeguard. Ultimately, I became a surf instructor for which I have been for many years throughout the coast of Clare.
 <br> <br>
 

I have been lucky enough to surf with excellent surfers throughout Ireland and Europe. 
This has allowed me to develop and become a more well-rounded surfer.
As my surfing developed, I overcame more than I ever thought I would, and am constantly learning more. 
I completely attribute this to the supportive surfing community which champions every ability and effort. 



This is the kind of community we have in Celtic Surf School (no matter the level); teamwork makes the dream work.  

  <br> <br>


 

At Celtic Surf School, my team and I want you to have some fun (catching a wave is a bonus.) 

We want to see a smile on your face when you catch your first wave.  

We will give you the time and experience we have learned over the years to help you become more comfortable in the ocean.
  <br> <br>

We hope here, at Celtic Surf School, that you will have a great experience in the ocean and learn how to catch some waves with us and our team  
 <br>
  <br>

Thanks for reading 
 <br>
  <br>
